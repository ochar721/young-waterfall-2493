## Overview

We are creating an application to track studios, movies, and actors

* Studios have a name and location
    * ex. name: 'Universal Studios', location: 'Hollywood'
* Movies have a title, creation year, and genre
    * ex. title: 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', creation_year: 1981, genre: 'Action/Adventure'
* Actors have a name, age, and currently_working (boolean) attributes
    * name: 'Harrison Ford', age: 78, currently_working: false
* Studios have many Movies
* Movies belong to a Studio
* Movies have many Actors
* Actors can be in many Movies

Some of the initial migrations and model set up has been done for you. After you set up your database, you should be able to run the tests and see two passing tests.

## User Stories
 
```
Story 1
Studio Show

As a user,
When I visit a studio show page
I see the studio's name and location
And I see the titles of all of its movies
```

```
Story 2
Studio's Actors

As a user,
When I visit a studio show page
I see a list of actors that have acted in any of the studio's movies
And I see that the list of actors is unique (no duplicate actors)
And I see that the list of actors is ordered from oldest actor to youngest
And I see that the list of actors only includes actors that are currently working
```

```
Story 3
Movie Show

As a user,
When I visit a movie's show page.
I see the movie's title, creation year, and genre,
and I see all of the actors in the movie
```

```
Story 4
Add an Actor to a Movie

As a user,
When I visit a movie show page,
I do not see any actors listed that are not part of the movie
And I see a form to add an actor to this movie
When I fill in the form with the name of an actor that exists in the database
And I click submit
Then I am redirected back to that movie's show page
And I see the actor's name is now listed

(You do not have to test for any sad path, for example if the name submitted does not match an existing actor)
```

## Extension

```
Extension
Coactors

As a user,
When I visit an actor's show page
I see that actors name and age
And I see a unique list of all of the actors this particular actor has worked with.
